## PQC TLS Measurements and Evaluations

Our measurements were originally conducted in an raw hardware with an optical splitter setup.
Details can be found under https://tumi8.github.io/pqs-tls-measurements
For the sake of reproducibility, we adapted our setup to run in an docker environment.

Requirements:
* Linux (ideally, `debian bullseye`)
* Installed Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/), we tested it with version 24.0.6
* Python3 `apt-get install python3`
* Python3 Libraries: `apt-get install python3-click python3-yaml`

To run our (dockerized) PQC TLS measurements:

```bash
./experiment.py --output-dir $RESULTS all-kem all-sig
```

We pre-defined the following experiments:

* all-kem
    * Evaluate all Key Agreements (KA) together with rsa:2048 as Signature Algorithm (SA)
* all-sig
    * Evaluate all SA together with X25519 as KA
* all-[kem|sig]-scenarios
  * same as all-kem and all-sig but with the emulated constrained environments
* level[1,2,3]
  * Every possible combination of SA and KA on the respective levels (we grouped level one and two together)

Our evaluations can be run with the `evaluate.py` script

```bash
./evaluate.py --output-dir $EVAL_OUTPUT $RESULTS/*
```

To reproduce the measurements from our paper, run each experiment (storing the results under `$RESULTS`). Then, run the evaluation script:

```bash
./experiment.py --output-dir $RESULTS all-kem all-sig all-kem-scenarios all-sig-scenarios level1 level3 level5
./evaluate.py --output-dir $EVAL_OUTPUT $RESULTS/*
```

You can also download the pcaps we captured on our hardware setup and evaluate them with the scripts. Note that you need the docker hosts needs Linux Kernel 5.9 (e.g., from `debian bullseye`) to analyze the cpu profilings. 

```bash
rsync rsync://m1725057@dataserv.ub.tum.de/m1725057/ $RAW_RESULTS/
./evaluate.py --output-dir $EVAL_OUTPUT $RAW_RESULTS/*
```

### Specialized Analyses

The evaluation script can be paramtereized with `--cpu-profiling True` and `--deviation-analysis True`. The former makes only sense if the CPU usage was monitored with `perf` (we published perf results, however, the docker scripts are unable to generate them), the latter makes only sense for the `level*` experiments.
